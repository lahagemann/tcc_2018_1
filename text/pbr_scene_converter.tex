\chapter{Introduction}

Ever since the development of modern Computer Graphics, one of the goals 
researchers aspired to was being able to synthesize images indistinguishable 
from real photographs. In order to produce physically accurate images, the 
process of image synthesis - also called \textbf{rendering} - simmulates the 
interaction of light with the representation of a three-dimensional scene. 
\textbf{Physically-Based Rendering} (PBR) is a complex process that requires 
thorough knowledge of optics, material properties, geometry and light 
propagation.

\section{Physically Based Rendering (PBR)}
Over the years, PBR became quite popular and was widely incorporated into the 
entertainment industries. From movies to videogames, from ads to interior 
design, PBR made it possible for artists to bring their creations and their 
vision one step closer to reality. Today, we can say that many - if not most - 
algorithms used in computer animation, geometric modeling and texturing require 
that their results be passed through some sort of rendering process. 

As PBR popularity grew, a brand new market opened up for physically-based (PB) 
renderers. Following the creation of \textit{PBRT} and the publishing of 
\textit{"Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation"} 
\cite{pbrt}, several other research-oriented renderers were created. Among them 
is \textit{Mitsuba}, one of the renderers chosen for this research, which places 
strong emphasis on experimental rendering techniques.

Following the lead of Pixar's \textit{Renderman} \cite{renderman}, many 
commercial and performance-oriented renderers appeared on the market. Focused 
on animation techniques and visual effects for movies, these 
renderers provide well-established, stable rendering techniques. These 
renderers, such as \textit{LuxRender} \cite{luxrender} and \textit{Octane} 
\cite{octane}, are state-of-the-art renderers used by the animation and gaming 
industries.

Even with different applications, the vast majority of modern 
PB renderers follows the same general guidelines for defining scene directives 
and world descriptions. Scene directives establish parameters such as which 
integration and sampling techniques the renderer must use, the view matrix and 
other camera properties. World descriptions state which objects compose the 
scene and which materials must be used to render them. This ensemble of 
descriptions is what, in PBR, is called a \textbf{scene}.

\section{Rendering a Scene}
% - the scene
<TO BE REWRITTEN>
The process of rendering an image usually starts with a scene. But what defines 
a scene? In PBR, a scene is a collection of descriptions: of the scene's 
geometry (the objects), of the objects' materials and textures, of the light 
sources and of the rendering techniques the user would like to use to form the 
image. This description is then read and interpreted by the renderer, and the 
scene is then processed into an output image.

But even with the vast array of softwares at our disposal, creating scenes is 
still a complex process. For instance, scenes created for architecture or 
design-oriented softwares often compile hundreds of 3D models and dozens of 
customized materials and textures, as shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:intro_complexScene}. Each material and texture has to be carefully 
defined, taking into account the target 
renderer's limitations and particularities. Crafting such scenes is an onerous, 
time-consuming effort: so much that
