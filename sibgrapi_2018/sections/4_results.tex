\section{Results and Analysis}
We validated our system's conversion using scenes from Bitterli's 32 resources 
\cite{resources16}. We chose scenes that provided a wide variety of directives 
in order to cover most commonly used directives. These scenes include: different 
types of materials and bumpmaps; 3D meshes and primitive shapes; image and 
primitive textures; area and environment lighting. 

The scenes were rendered using Mitsuba 0.5.0, PBRT v3 and LuxRender v1.6 on 
%a UNIX system running
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. All scenes were rendered using over 5,000 samples per pixel.

\subsection{Limitations}
In order to minimize scope issues, we restricted the number of directives 
interpreted by our system. Generally speaking, directives present in only one 
renderer that had no correspondent in the other two renderers were not 
incorporated. That was the case, for instance, for Mitsuba-only materials like 
\textit{phong} or \textit{blendbsdf}. 

We chose not to interpret and convert hair or participating media (volumes, such 
as water or fog) for this PoC. We also did not convert the color for metal 
materials in LuxRender given the issues discussed in \ref{systemarch}. The 
latter can be observed in Figure \ref{fig:coffee} - we can see the lack of a 
copper color on the lamp in the image rendered by LuxRender.
