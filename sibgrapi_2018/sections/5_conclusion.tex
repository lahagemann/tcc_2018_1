\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We presented a system for automatic conversion among scene file formats used by Monte Carlo physically-based rendering systems. 
It enables algorithms implemented using different renderers to be tested on similar scene descriptions, providing better means of assessing the strengths and limitations of MC rendering techniques.

Our system can be easily integrated with the API recently introduced by~\cite{Santos:2018:FBKSD}, allowing researchers and developers to exploit full orthogonality among MC algorithms, rendering systems, and scene files.   

We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our system by converting scene description among three of the most popular MC rendering systems: PBRT v3, Mitsuba, and LuxRender. Providing support to additional renderers only requires specializing the import and export modules described in Section~\ref{sec:systemarch} for the given renderers. Our system is freely available and we encourage developers to provide support for other renderers.  

In the future, we would like to add support for the conversion of hair and participating media, as well as for other rendering systems.
By documenting limitations and incompatibilities found among different renderers, our work might stimulate efforts to reduce these differences.
